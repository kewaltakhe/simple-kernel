## About
During my college years, I learned about computer system architecture and operating systems. While I gained insights through separate experiments, I always wanted a more holistic understanding of the intricate connection between hardware and software.<br><br>
This project, born from that curiosity, provides a hands-on exploration of the fascinating journey from computer hardware to software. It experiments with BIOS loading the bootsector, Memory-mapped device drivers. Then, step by step, towards a kernel using the higher-level language C is created. This project acts as an entry point to the process of building an operating system from scratch.
